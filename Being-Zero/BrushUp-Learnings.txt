1. To find no of digits in a number = (int) log10(n) + 1
2. No of multiples of n in [a, b] is floor(b - a + 1 / n)
    eg: No of multiples in [20, 300] of 5:
        20=5×4 and 300=5×60. So it has from 4th multiple to 60th. 
        Thus including 20 and 300 it has 60−4+1=57 multiples.

1. Prefix sum subarray technique
2. n & (n - 1) removes rightmost set bit in n
3. n & (-n) every bit except rightmost set bit unsets
4. no. of bits in n / leftmost set bit position in n: 1 + log2(n)
5. The number 0xAAAAAAAA is a 32 bit number with all even bits set as 1 and all odd bits as 0. 
6. The number 0x55555555 is a 32 bit number with all odd bits set as 1 and all even bits as 0.
